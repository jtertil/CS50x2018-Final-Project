## About:
Word-based game - language learning helper. Practice project presented as my final project in [CS50](https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-to-computer-science) course. 
My first app that has a practical purpose (and a lot of bad practices and stinky code). :) 
Currently Offline because of changes in Oxford Dictionaries API.
